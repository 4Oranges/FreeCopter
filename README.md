# Free Copter

_A tool set to free flight controller usage_

This project aims to create an extensible flight controller system working in parallel with any existing controller and takes the advantage of existing functionality even it's an commercial close-source solution while extending the whole system.

This solution is simply an wrapper generate or forward input signal to the target controller. And thus the __Free Copter Controller__ can controls the behavior of the target controller by controls the wrapper.

#### Description:
- The Target Controller is the said commercial close-source controller, like an DJI flight controller.  
- The Wrapper is an MCU for signal processes, like forwarding or and generating. I'm using Nuvoton M0518SD2AE here for developing. The wrapper itself is totally controlled by the __Free Copter Controller__.
- The Signal Source is just an normal signal source, maybe a radio receiver used with most flight controllers, like the FUTABA stuffs. This is an important part for it not only can controls the target controller, but also can controls the __Free Copter Controller__ through the wrapper. In this condition, you can controls the whole system with __only one signal source__ and there is no need to change the old system to add other control method like bluetooth or ethernet. Though, it's also optional in Free Copter, for its __Free__ usage, and you can control the whole system by controls the __Free Copter Controller__ directly. It's all up to you.
- The Free Copter Controller is a system that support the __wrapper control protocol__(described below), and connected to the wrapper with supported connector(described below, currently i2c/smbus). The __wrapper control protocol__ provides a set of functions to control the wrapper, and is the base-layer of the __Free Copter API__. Currently the __wrapper control protocol__ is developed on Raspberry Pi 2 Module B, with Linux ARM OS.
- The __Free Copter API__ communicate with the __Free Copter Wrapper__ through the __wrapper control protocol__, and provide the functionality of controlling the wrapper, or get the signal from wrapper. It also provides a set APIs to deal with more complex tasks.
